# Solar Forecasting with Deep Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning and deep learning methods to forecast solar flare activity using historical solar data and satellite observations.

## Motivation

Understanding and predicting solar activity is critical for protecting space and ground-based technologies from solar storms. This project investigates deep learning approaches to forecast flare probabilities within 12-hour windows.

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training
- `data/`: Datasets (fetched externally or from Google Drive)
- `models/`: Saved model weights
- `app/`: Web GUI and associated scripts for real time forecasting service
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies
